* If they get a strike, they score ten pins plus the number of pins knocked down on their next two rolls.
* If they get a spare, they scores ten pins plus the number of pins knocked down on their next roll.
* If the bowler fails to knock down all ten pins they score the number of pins knocked down.
* The scores accumulate through all ten frames.
* At the last frame, if necessary, the pins are reset for one or two additional rolls to count the final bonus.
